Regression testing tool using Wandb API.

## Usage:
The tool is most efficiently used through importing the PyPI package for the tool:

` from regressiontestingreport import report_generation `

From here, a report can be generated by calling the "generate_report" function with a parameter you want to track, the name of your Wandb project project, and the name of your Wandb entity:

` report_generation.generate_report(<parameter_name>, <project_name>, <entity_name>) `

Your Wandb key should be included as a environment variable if you wish to automatically log in (Wandb may prompt you to create an account otherwise).
